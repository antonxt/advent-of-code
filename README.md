# My solutions to Advent of Code 2017 challenge
More details about the challenge [here](http://adventofcode.com/2017/about).

I used [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks (`*.ipynb` files) to run my code, which is written in Python. The inputs to some days' puzzles are in `/in/dayXX.txt` files. Other inputs are done directly in the notebooks for the related days.
